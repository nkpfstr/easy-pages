OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Soothe us with sweet lies.

Soothe us with sweet lies. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Fatal. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

## Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Who are you, my warranty?! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!

And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Hey, whatcha watching?

### Fatal.

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Oh yeah, good luck with that. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? No argument here. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. I'll get my kit! Bender?! You stole the atom.

Why not indeed! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!
