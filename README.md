# Github Pages Demo

Did you know that you can create and publish a Github Pages website without installing any tools on your local machine? Since Github Pages sites are built with Jekyll on the server side, you can create the files you need through right here on Github.com, turn on Github Pages in your repository settings and visit the supplied URL. Tada! You have a working static website.
